= Bank Operation

== Objective:

== To implement a RESTful service for bank operations. such as deposit, withdraw, transfer, and balance check.

=== Pre-Requirements

* https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/17/[jdk17]
* https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[docker-compose]
* https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[docker]
* https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[maven]
* https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make[make]
* for sonar verification you need to have user/password and placed inside setting.xml

== Security

* Api is protected with jwt authentication, you need to pass jwt token in header for each request.
* 

To generate a token, you can use the following curl command:

[source,bash]
----
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8081/token/generate/?username=alice&role=alice"
----

== Technologies

————
- `Spring Boot`
- `Spring MVC`, for creating RESTful API
- `postgres`, database for persisting the customer information
- `Docker`, for containerization of services
- `Docker-Compose`, to link the containers
- `Swagger`, Swagger-UI, for API documentation
- `Actuator`, Monitoring the app, gathering metrics, understanding traffic.
- `JaCoCo`, for code coverage
- `Pit-Test`, for mutation testing
- `Sonar`, for code quality
- `Testcontainers`, for unit test

== How to's

=== Run

* `make run-apps`

== Test

* `make test`

####

==== mutation testing

* `mvn clean install org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage`

____

You can access the report at : `{project-dir}/target/pit-reports/{currenttime}/index.html`

____

=== Build with report

* `make report`

____

You can access the report at `/{project_path}/target/site/jacoco/index.html`

____

=== Sonar

* `make start` (to initialize sonar Docker image)

____

Sonar run will work only on docker run and valid sonar user/password

____

=== Decisions

____

.

____

=== Future Steps

* Use Testcontainers for unit test so real database can be simulated
* Use caching technology for status check
* Apply CI/CD pipeline
* JWT implement via spring security
* Multithreading for concurrent request via Cache

=== Api Sample

=== Read all customers

[source,bash]
----
   GET http://127.0.0.1:8081/api/v1/administration/customers
   Accept: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}
----

=== Create a customer

[source,bash]
----
   POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/administration/customers
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}
   
   {
   
     "active": true,
     "siebelId": "TEST081",
     "firstName": "aryan",
     "lastName": "Shashi",
     "email": "singh@gmail.com",
     "countryCode": "EU",
     "customerType": "ORGANIZATION",
   }
